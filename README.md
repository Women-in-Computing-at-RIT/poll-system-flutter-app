# poll-system-flutter-app
Flutter code for the mobile app front end.

## Libraries Used

Used [flutter_launcher_icons](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons) 0.7 to change the launcher icons to the otter.

NOTE: Because the config is in the pubspec.yaml file you don't need `-f` when running:
`flutter packages pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`. Remember to run `flutter packages get` before this if you haven't run the new version yet.
